# Library Challenge
This contains code for a challenge to create a library system, combining 
exceptions, inheritance, interfaces, etc.  
  
## Usage: 
To run the code look to `src/main/java/main/Runner.java` as this 
contains the main method.  
  
All the items in the library, i.e. books, magazines, etc. derive from an 
'item' class, with 'DigitalMedia' and 'WrittenMedia' classes extending 
from that (all three are abstract)  
  
There also exists an interface class called 'listenable' (found in the 
`utils/` directory, which is for items like audio-books.
